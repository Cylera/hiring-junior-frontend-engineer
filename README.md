# Cylera Junior Frontend Developer Take-home Programming Assignment

The goal of this project is to build a single component used to render the provided dataset as a table of payload counts by country and display the data in a doughnut chart. We've created a design for this component, and your job is to implement it. This repo is a starting point, with some of the scaffolding in place to get you started. You're expected to use the following technologies in your solution:

- React with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

_Note:_ Your solution won't be viewed on a mobile device but it does need to be responsive.

## The Design

Figma Prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/4YRep3EnjvbRhlgJnZ4fMl/Tailwind-Figma-UI?node-id=4030%3A49919

_Note:_ The designs use a proprietary font called Proxima Nova. You are not expected to use this font. Please use an alternative but similar in appearance font.

_Note:_ The designs do not necessarily display accurate data. They are intended to describe the appearance of the component but the numbers you compute may be different.

## Components & Features

### Launches by nationality

- Pie chart by nationality
- Legend with count for each country

_Note:_ You should be prepared to discuss the decisions that were made throughout the development process.

## Dataset

A sample dataset is provided under `./dataset/missions.json`. **Do not alter this file**. It is intended to be used as if it were provided from a server. So please instead, read this file and perform any processing you see fit on the data in memory.

## Deadline & Submission

You have a week to complete this assignment. It shouldn't take that long, but we're giving you enough time to get familiar with the project. To begin your work, you should fork this repo. When you're ready to submit, share the repo with us and provide instructions to run your assignment.

## Scoring Rubric

We'll be assessing the final product on the following criteria:

1. Accuracy of the UI compared to the design
2. Functionality of the interactive components
3. Code quality.

## Getting Started

This is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app --template typescript`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) and modified to provide a starting point for this assignment. You are free to update the starting point as you see fit. To get started simply:

1. Install dependancies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
4. Make changes in `src/` and elsewhere as needed to implement your solution.
